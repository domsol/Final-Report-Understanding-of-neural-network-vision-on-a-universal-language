Quick guide:

Download the Final report for full details on the project's goals, research, method and outcome. AI model and Dataset were not added due to size however following the code and links this can be reproduced.

Chapters:

Chapter 1 goes over the project overview.
Chapter 2 goes over research on AI and image recognition.
Chapter 3 goes over the methodology of all required steps.
Chapter 4 for a more detailed understanding of the code and requirements.
Chapter 5 goes over the outcome and results.
Chapter 6 final understanding.

All code is written in Python. Details on code sourced within the PFD document: Final Report.pdf.
uses of the code in steps
1. The code takes from a set file an existing database of traffic lights (not included due to size) to first filter and normalise the images.
2. These filtered images are used to train a machine learning AI.
3. This lets the user access the AI to test its correctness and input their new images for the machine-guided result.
4. The code can take the matrix images from different node levels within the neural network to identify patterns.
