quick guide:

Download the Final report to fully view it. model and dataset were not added due to size.

project overview - go to Chapter 1 for the project overview. chapter 2 also goes over research which can give a better insight into different steps.
code - go to Chapter 4 for a more detailed understanding. 4.7 overs over the needed requirements and use of code.
results - Chapter 5 goes over how I came to these results while Chapter 6 has the final understanding written.

All code is written in Python. 
uses of the code in steps
1. The code uses an existing database of traffic lights (not included due to size) to first filter and normalise the images.
2. Then it takes this data and uses it to train a trained machine learning AI.
3. This lets the user access the machine learning AI to test how correct it is and also to input their own images and get the guessed result.
4. then using the AI it can take the matrix images the AI sees in its nodes and display them to the user for research.
